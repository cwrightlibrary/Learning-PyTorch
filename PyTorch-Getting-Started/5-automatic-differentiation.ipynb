    "**Back propagation** is the most frequently used algorithm when training neural networks. In back propagation, parameters, or model weights, are adjusted according to the **gradient** of the loss function with respect to the given parameter. Here's a quick overview of some terms for clarification:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **Loss function** is a formula that measures **how bad the model's prediction is** compared to the actual target. It's essentially a score that we want to be low, it's best to minimize the loss function during training.\n",
    "- The **gradient** is the **slope of the loss function** with respect to the model's parameters (weights and biases). We can use it to learn **how to change the parameters** to reduce the loss. If the gradient is positive, we want to decrease the weight and if it's negative, we want to increase it. It's calculated using **calculus** (specifically, partial derivatives).\n",
    "- **Back propagation** is the algorithm used to **efficiently compute all gradients** of the loss with respect to every weight in the network. In it, we do a **forward pass**, which is used for computing predictions and loss, and a **backward pass**, where we apply the chain rule to propagate gradients from output to input. The gradients returned from back propagation are used to **update the weights**, typically via gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In PyTorch, we use the built-in differentiation engine `torch.autograd` to compute the gradients. It supports automatic computation of gradient for any computational graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let's consider the simplest one-layer neural network, with input `x`, parameters `w` and `b`, and some loss function. It can be defined in PyTorch like so:"
