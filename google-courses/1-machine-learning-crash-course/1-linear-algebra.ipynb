    "**Linear regression** is a type of machine learning model in which the model is a linear model and the prediction is a floating-point value. (This is the regression part of *linear regression*). It's a statistical technique used to find the relationship between variables. In a machine learning (ML) context, it finds the relationship between **features**, which is an input variable to a machine learning model, and a **label**, which is, in supervised machine learning, the \"answer\" or \"result\" portion of an example.\n",
