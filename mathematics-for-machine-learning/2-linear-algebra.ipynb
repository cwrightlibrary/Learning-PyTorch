    "## 2. Linear algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "It's common to construct a set of objects, or symbols, and a set of rules to manipulate the objects to formalize intuitive concepts. This process is known as **algebra**. Linear algebra is the study of vectors and certain rules to manipulate vectors. The simple vectors I may already know are called *geometric vectors*, which are usually denoted by a small arrow above the letter, e.g., $\\overrightarrow{x}$ and $\\overrightarrow{y}$. In this book, we'll be going over more general concepts of vectors and use a bold letter to represent them, e.g., $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors are special objects that can be added together and multiplied by scalars to produce another object of the same kind. Any object that satisfies these two properties can be considered a vector. Below are some examples of such vector objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Geometric vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the more familiar vector. Geometric vectors $\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{x}}$, $\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{y}}$ can be added, such that $\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{x}}+\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{y}}=\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{z}}$ is another geometric vector. Multiplication by a scalar is also a geometric vector: $\\lambda \\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{x}},\\lambda\\in\\mathbb{R}$. Interpreting vectors as geometric vectors enables us to use our intuitions about direction and magnitude to reason about mathematical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Polynomials\n",
    "\n",
    "**Polynomials** are also vectors: two polynomials can be added together, which results in another polynomial; and they can be multiplied by a scalar $\\lambda\\in\\mathbb{R}$, and the result is a polynomial. This makes polynomials, kind of unusual, instances of vectors. However, they can be very different than geometric vectors. Geometric vectors are concrete *drawings* and polynomials are *abstract concepts*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Audio signals\n",
    "\n",
    "**Audio signals** are represented as a series of numbers. We can add audio signals together, and their sum is a new audio signal. We can also scale an audio signal and still obtain an audio signal. So, oddly, audio signals are a type of vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Elements of $\\mathbb{R}^n$\n",
    "\n",
    "Elements of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ (**tuples of** $\\mathbf{n}$ **real numbers**) are vectors. $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is more abstract than polynomials, and it is the concept we focus on in this book. For instance,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a=\\left[\\begin{matrix}1\\\\2\\\\3\\end{matrix}\\right]\\in\\mathbb{R}^3$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is an example of a triplet of numbers. Adding two vectors, $\\mathbf{a,b}\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ component-wise results in another vector: $\\mathbf{a}+\\mathbf{b}=\\mathbf{c}\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$. Considering vectors as elements of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ has another benefit that loosely corresponds to arrays of real numbers on a computer. Many programmng languages support array opertations, which allow for convenient implementation of algorithms that involve vector operations."
